# My First Python Projects

This repository contains basic Python scripts I've built as part of my journey to become a Backend Developer.

## Projects Included

- `calculator.py` â€“ A simple calculator for basic arithmetic.
- `todo_list.py` â€“ A command-line To-Do list app.
- `number_guess_game.py` â€“ A small number guessing game using random numbers.

These are my early projects as I continue to learn Python, Django, and backend development.
